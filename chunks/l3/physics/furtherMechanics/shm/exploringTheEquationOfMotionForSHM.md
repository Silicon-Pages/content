To recap, the *general* equation of motion for SHM is,

$$
	x = A\cos(\omega t + \phi)
$$

Where $\omega$ is the angular freqency of the motion, and $A$ and $\phi$ are arbitrary constants.

# Plotting the motion

Let's plot the equation above, for $0\le x\le \frac{4\pi}{\omega}$, and for $\phi = 0$

[DIAGRAM]

Firstly, we see that the motion repeats itself after $t = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$, suggesting that the period of the motion is,

$$*
	T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
$$

We should have guessed this from circular motion (in fact the maths here is going to look awfully similar to that of circular motion).

Secondly, we see that the **amplitude** of the motion (maximum distance from equilibrium) is $A$.
