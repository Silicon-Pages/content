SHM is the study of one very specific type of motion (what defines that motion we will get onto in but a moment). We study SHM because many physical systems, if they do not display perfect SMH (which many do), can be approximately modelled as if they do display SHM. The classical example is the pendulum, which only displays SHM for small angle oscillations. They are other (and more exciting) examples of approximate SHM. Molecular vibrations, the motion of sound waves through solids, and many quantum effects, have their analysis simplified on the basis that they can be approximately modelled as displaying SHM.
