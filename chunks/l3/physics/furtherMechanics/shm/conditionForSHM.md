# Condition

As far as the exam wants you to know, the condition for SHM is that the acceleration of the body is *directly* proportional to *negative* of the bodies displacement from equilibrium.

[DIAGRAM]

$$*
	a\propto -x
$$

Don't be fooled into writing 'inversely proportional' in the exam. Inverse proportion referes to a different mathematical relationship, of the form $y\propto\frac{1}{x}$. In SHM the acceleration is *directly* proportional to the *negative* of the position.

# Definition

The proportionality relation above implies a defining equation for SHM:

$$*
	a = -\omega^2 x
$$

Where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the motion.
