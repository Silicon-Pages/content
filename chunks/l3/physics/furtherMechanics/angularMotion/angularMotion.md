Let's get something straight to start out with: Circular motion is just linear motion, in which the direction of motion is constantly changing. This might seem like an obvious point but it is worth bearing in mind. All of the analysis we do for particles moving in straight lines, or in arcs like in projectile motion, still applies to circular motion. All the analysis of circular motion does, is give us a way to easily discribe rotating bodies.

In angular motion we can define a new set of properties (angular velocity, angular momentum, moment, etc), however, these are all defined in terms of their linear counterparts, and are not really *new* properties at all.

So, with that in mind, we can set up the framework for dealing with objects moving in circles.
