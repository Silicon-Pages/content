Let's get something straight to start out with: Circular motion is just linear motion, in which the direction of motion is constantly changing. This might seem like an obvious point but it is worth pointing out. All of the analysis we do for particles moving in straight lines, or in arcs like in projectile motion, still applies to circular motion. The topic of circular motion just gives us a convenient way to easily discribe rotating bodies without having to always do some long winded analysis.

In angular motion we define a new set of properties (angular velocity, angular momentum, moment, etc), however, these are all defined in terms of their linear counterparts, and are not really *new* properties at all. They are new ways of looking at our linear variables that are *useful* when dealing with rotating bodies.

So, with that in mind, we can set up the framework for dealing with objects moving in circles.
