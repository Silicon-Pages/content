Quarks are defined as fermions which do engage with the strong force. Now, we have already said that particles that experience the strong force are known as hadrons (not quarks), however, quarks are fundamental particles whereas hadrons are made up from smaller particles (namely quarks).

In the hadron section we said that it was thought for many years that hadrons were fundamental particles (in fact, in the Feynmann lectures you can find Richard Feynmann describing hadrons as fundamental). This is because you cannot observe a lone quark - it is physically impossible, they always exist either in pairs or in threes. This phenomenon is known as quark confinement.

The reason for their discovery was a man called Murray Gellman. He managed to spot symmetries in the ways that baryons and mesons behaved, and using this observation was able to deduce that you could explain the symmetries by supposing that all the hadrons observed in nature were composed of combinations of 6 quarks and their corresponding antiquarks, each with different masses and charges.

Quarks were ultimately confirmed to exist by scattering experiments that managed to spot three concentrated regions of mass within the proton, thus confirming Gellmann's theory.
