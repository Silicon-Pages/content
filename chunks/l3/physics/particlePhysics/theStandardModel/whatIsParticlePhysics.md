Particle physics has always been about one thing: Working out what stuff is made from, and how those things (whatever they are) interact with each other to produce the large scale structures and forces that we experience.

*What* particle physics has actually studied has changed over the years, as we have found ever smaller componenets to matter, and more groupings of the forces into the same fundamental action. For example, it was once thought that atoms were indivisible units to matter, however, we now know this to be incorrect. It was also thought, initially, that the electric and magnetic forces were two distinct forces in nature, however, we now know them to be caused by a common mechanism.

In terms of the practicalities of particle physics there are two branches: The empirical and the theoretical. Sometimes new particles are found experimentally and it is up to the theorists to fit them into the existing theories, however, more often than not particles are theorised to exist, and are actively searched for in particle experiments.

Historically particles were hypothesised to accout for various physical phenomena (the electron was thought to exist to account for electrostatic phenomena). In the modern age particles are hypothesised based on the symmetry of the universe (to be discussed in a seperate section). The standard model has been entirely constructed in theory this way, and has been verified in it's entirety - it is a very well supported theory.
