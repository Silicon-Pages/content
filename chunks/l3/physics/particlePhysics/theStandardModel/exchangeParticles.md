In nature there are forces which exist. We know this to be true since we observe forces at the large scale, however, there must be some fundamental force at play, at the particle level, which gives rise to the macroscopic observations.

When we look deeply into particle physics we find that there are only really four forces at play. One is the electromagnetic force, one is gravity, and then there is the strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces. Gravity is not currently described by quantum theory, however, the other three are described in roughly the same way:
	- There is some field that mediates the force
	- There is some property of matter (known as the coupling constant) which regulates the strength of the force acting on that particle
	- The field then acts to exchange conserved quantities (most intuituvely, momentum, between the particles).


An example helps explain: For the electromagnetic force the field is the electromagnetic field, and the property of matter is electric charge - the greater the charge of a particle, the more strongly it experiences the force - and photons act to exchange momentum between the charged particles (they either pull them together or push them appart depending on the relative signs of their charges). Importantly, it is the action of the force field which mediates the exchange of the property.

The interesting thing that happens in particle physics is that the excitation of the field associated with the exchange can be thought of as a particle (known as a gauge boson) being exchanged between the two interacting particles. So in the case of the electromagnetic force we can think of the exchange as being mediated by the exchange of a photon. The term gauge boson has two parts: Boson indicates that the force-carrying particles are bosonic in nature (this is predicated mathematically and observed experimentally) and gauge is a term that arises due to the fact that the existence of gauge bosons is a result of the various symmetries of the universe (although that is beyond the scope of this discussion).

Importantly, as stated above, gauge bosons *can* be thought of as particles, rather than simply excitations in a field. This is an important point to make, and leads us to describe force carriers as **virtual particles**. What virtual actually means is that the particles are a product of the maths - they are not actually physically observable and do not exist in the same way that *real* particles do. The defining characteristic of virtual particles is that they exist within the constraints of the Heisenburg uncertainty principle, and hence are only temporary.
