So, hadrons are made from quarks. It was predicted that baryons (fermionic hadrons) were composed of three quarks and that mesons (bosonic hadrons) were composed of a quark and an antiquark. How does this help explain the properties of hadrons?

Well, for a start, quarks possess colour charge, and hence interact via the strong force. This is the reason for all hadrons interacting via the strong nuclear force - they composed of particles which themselves interact via the strong force.

As for there being two type of hadron (baryons and mesons) this comes down to quark confinement. One of the key properties of quarks is that they cannot be observed alone. More precisely, for a particle to be able to exist in nature it must be colour neutral - that is have a colour of white. Quarks are not white, they are either red, green or blue, and hence cannot exist alone. However, this refined version of quark confinement also rules out all combinations of quarks that do not give a white particle overall.

Baryons are fine, since they are composed of three quarks. One quark can be blue, one green and the other red, making a particle that is white overall (using the constructive rules for combining colors). Mesons are also fine since one quark can be red, green or blue, and the anti-quark can be the corresponding anticolour (antigreen is magenta and so on), producing white overall.

Since quarks are fermions (half integer spin) three quarks will also produce a half integer spin particle (a fermion), while two quarks (a quark and anti-quark to be more accurate) will produce an integer spin particle (a boson). And so we see that the existence of quarks explains away all the properties of hadrons, and puts them down to the different ways that quarks are permitted to exist together.
