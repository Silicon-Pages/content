Alpha decay is one form of radioactive decay in which a heavy, positively charged particle is observed to be emitted from the centre of an atom. The particle that is seen to emerge is dubbed the alpha particle, and we can observe it's properties through a series of experiments.

# Motion of Alpha Particles in magnetic fields

The first of the experiments we can do is construct a magnetic field (using large coils of wire or some other set-up) and observe the path of the alpha particle through this field using a cloud chamber (or a more modern particle detector).

In magnetic fields, charged particles move in spirals, and when the strength of the magnetic field is just right, in perfect circles - the strength of magnetic field needed for a circular path depends only on the charge to mass ratio (CMR) of the particle.

In the case of the alpha particle we can deduce this value, and in the process deduce that it has a positive charge.

# Penetrating Power of Alpha Particles

# Ionising Power of Alpha Particles


Upon closer inspection (using spectroscopy methods and observing the particle's track in a cloud chamber) we can deduce that the alpha particle has a charge of $+2e$ (2 relative charge) and a mass of $\sim 4m_p$. The logical deducation that we can make from this evidence (combined with the fact that alpha particles themselves are observed to be stable, and do not decay further) is that alpha particles are made up from two protons (giving the correct charge) and two neutrons (making up the mass).
