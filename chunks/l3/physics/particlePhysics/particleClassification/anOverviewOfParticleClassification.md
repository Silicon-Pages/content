In particle physics there are lots of terms which are thrown about to describe particles - fermion, boson, hadron, quark, lepton, etc, etc, etc. Some terms are mutually exlusive (a particle is either a fermion or a boson, never both) or they can be used to describe the same particle (there are hadrons which are also fermions or bosons). Fundamentally there is nothing special about these terms, and in general a particle can be described by one of these terms if it displays a certain property. Some properties are mutually exclusive (a particle cannot both have mass and no mass at the same time) and some can exist together (a particle can have massless and have no charge), hence we obtain the same overlap in the words we use to describe the particles.

As I have said, there is nothing particularly special about how we classify particles - it is mainly for convenience. The universe didn't create the standrd model, we did.

Further, the study of particle physics is inherently empirical. That is, we do not really know why the standard model is the way it is at all. We don't know why there are only 6 quarks we can observe (or if there might be more), or why the force carriers that exist do, in fact, exist. Particle physics, to date, has largely been a job of looking for new particles, and then classifying them.
