The term hadron refers to any particle that experiences the strong nuclear force. Protons and neutrons are both hadrons, however, there are many more hadrons in nature that display different properties. The term hadron exists alongside the terms fermion and boson, as there exist hadrons that are fermions, and there exist hadrons which are bosons.

We can subdivide the hadrons into two groups. Hadrons which are also fermions we call baryons, and hadrons which are also bosons we call mesons. At the time of this classification it was thought that all hadrons were fundamental particles. We now know this to be false, however, given that this is how the classification was made originally I will leave discussion of the true identity of hadrons to a later section.
